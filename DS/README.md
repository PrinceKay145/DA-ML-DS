## Data Science Projects

This folder contains a collection of data science projects focused on data exploration, analysis, and visualization. 

**Project Structure:**

* Each project is in a separate subfolder within this directory.
* A typical project subfolder may contain:
    * `data`: Stores raw data files used in the project.
    * `src`: Python scripts for data processing and analysis.
    * `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (optional).
    * `results`: Output files, visualizations, or models generated by the project.
    * `README.md`: A project-specific README file with details like problem addressed, methodology, and findings.
