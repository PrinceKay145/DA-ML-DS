## DA-ML-DS

**A repository showcasing my Data Science and Machine Learning projects.**

This repository is a collection of my work in data science and machine learning, categorized into *3* folders:

**Data Analysis (DA)**

**Data Science (DS)**

The `DS` folder contains projects focused on data exploration, analysis, and visualization using techniques like:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Statistical analysis
* Data visualization with libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.

**Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML-AI)**

The `ML-AI` folder encompasses projects involving machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques, including:

* Supervised learning (classification, regression)
* Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
* Deep learning (neural networks)

Each project within these folders has its own README file with specific details about the problem addressed, the approach taken, results achieved, and code used.

**Feel free to explore the project folders and learn more!**
